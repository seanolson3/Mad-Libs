#String concatenation
mad_lib = (f"I was going to be rich! I had just invented the first electric {noun1}. \
Using a(n) {noun2} from {sibling}’s toolbox, I built it out of old {noun_p1}, metal {noun_p2},\
and rubber {noun_p3}. The first time I turned it on, the machine worked {adverb_ly}. I couldn’t \
believe it! “{exclamation}!” I yelled, {verb_ing1} up and down. I invited a(n) {adj1} billionaire \
to check out my invention. I couldn’t wait to sell it for {numb} million dollars and live like \
{celeb}. But when I turned it on, something went terribly {adj2}. The machine started \
{verb_ing2} and began to {verb1}. Suddenly it spewed {slimy} and shot slices of {noun3} in all \
directions. The billionaire started screaming at the top of his {body_part} and {verb_pt} out of my lab. \
Good thing I still get my weekly allowance.")
